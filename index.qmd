## Bio

I’m a PhD candidate in Economic History at Lund University. My research is focused on understanding the drivers of innovation and the impact of inventions on society and industry from the end of the 18th century to today. As part of [Faustine Perrin's project](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/faustine-perrin), I specifically concentrate on the role of women in the development process through their patented inventions.

I specialize in building extensive, long-run databases by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. This process turns unstructured data into structured resources for in-depth studies across long timespans.

Click here for a list of my [papers](research\index.qmd), [talks](talks.qmd), information related to my [teaching activities](teaching.qmd), ["Kappa" draft, introductory chapter of my dissertation](research/working_papers/Merouani-Dissertation-Kappa.pdf/working_papers/Merouani-Patent-Collaboration-Networks.pdf), and here for [my Academic CV](Youssouf_Merouani_shortCV.pdf).
