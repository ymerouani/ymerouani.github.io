The past decade has witnessed a boom and increasing literature about the role played by women and gender in long-run economic development. The increasing awareness of economics and economic history have contributed to improve our understanding of the crucial role played by women in the process of economic development.

    "text": "ABSTRACT: Covid-19 increased the social and economic vulnerability of island societies. Swedish islands, key tourism destinations, are also home to many island residents. Previous studies have highlighted the impact of Covid-19 on core areas, but our knowledge of its impact on island communities is lacking. Phenomenology is used to analyse how communities in small Swedish islands perceive the impact of Covid-19. Institutional theory and the concepts of social capital and accessibility are employed in the analysis. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups with islanders and representatives of local organizations on sampled islands. Pandemic regulations affected island communities differently. Authorities and shipping companies endeavored to discourage people from visiting islands, which negatively affected tourism in some islands, while tourism increased in others. Informal institutions established a basis for good community relations; they enabled the mobilization of social capital, especially given action by local agents who were endorsed by the community. Cooperation was a key factor in reducing negative impacts. Accessibility increased on islands with well-developed and expanded IT-infrastructure, enabling holiday homeowners to work from their holiday islands. This development helped create a sustained positive economic trend for grocery stores and the construction industry.\nKeywords: Island societies • Covid-19 • institutions • social capital • accessibility\nPDF"

    "text": "ABSTRACT: The lion’s share of entrepreneurship research highlights conditions in core regions, while entrepreneurship in peripheral areas has been less studied. This longitudinal study aims at exploring the interplay between the peripheral contexts of island and archipelago communities and firm outcomes - paying special attention to spatial variations and non-linear temporal dimensions. We focus on the survival of all firms active on 17 islands in the Stockholm archipelago, Sweden during a 20-year period (2000-2019). Using longitudinal multilevel modelling, we find that - despite being a seemingly ‘homogeneous’ place - spatial and temporal variations, however small, would have substantial effects on the conditions for everyday entrepreneurship in these communities. Our results show that firms located on islands with higher population density and seasonal dependability face increased probabilities of exit, while access to digital ecosystems, local services in the form of kindergartens, and year-round grocery stores decrease the probabilities of exit. Islands with thicker institutional context, indicating trust and community support, lead to higher survival rates.\nKeywords: Entrepreneurial context • Islandness • Firm survival • Everyday entrepreneurship • Peripherality\nOnline chapter | PDF"

    "text": "ABSTRACT: This paper explores the representation of women inventors in historical records and uncovers potential biases that influence our current understanding of history. By examining a comprehensive database of nineteenth-century French patents as a case study, we discover that women filed more patents than contemporary biographical records suggest. Further, we illustrate that women’s inventive endeavors spanned all industries, challenging the perception that their contributions were confined to specific sectors. Beyond enhancing our awareness of women’s patenting endeavors, our findings underscore the need to confront systematic biases and exclusionary practices in historical documentation. Such efforts are necessary for fostering a more inclusive and accurate comprehension of women’s contributions to technological development and economic processes.\nKeywords: Patent • Innovation • Gender • Women • Nineteenth Century • France\nJEL Classification: J16, N33, O30\nPDF"
